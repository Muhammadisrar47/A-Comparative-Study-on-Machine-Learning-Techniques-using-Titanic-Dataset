# A-Comparative-Study-on-Machine-Learning-Techniques-using-Titanic-Dataset
This project compares machine learning algorithms (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, SVM,KNN) on the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival. It evaluates performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
